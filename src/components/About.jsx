        After 7+ years of working professionally as an accountant, I realized I
        was no longer fulfilled in the industry. I decided to uncover my long
        lost passion for development prior to my accounting days. After
        enrolling in a web development bootcamp to enhance my skills and sharpen
        my craft, where I learned more about the back-end and databases to
        become a truly rounded Full Stack Web Developer.
        <br />I truly believe Web Developers are leading the way to create a
        better internet for everyone. As my mantra, I practice this everyday
        whether that be through making websites I develop accessible or
        improving the usability of my apps.
        <br />
        When I am not starring at a computer screen you can usually find me
        outdoors hiking or hanging out with my friends.
