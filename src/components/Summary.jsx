        After 7+ years of working professionally as an accountant, I realized I
        was no longer fulfilled in the industry. That is when I decided to
        rediscover my long lost passion for creating websites. To better enhance
        and tone my skills, I enrolled into a web development bootcamp to learn
        more about the back-end and database to become a truly rounded
        Full-Stack Web Developer. My instructor had once mentioned as Web Developers
        we are creating a better Internet for everyone and I truly believe that
        to be true whether through accessibilty or making apps easier to use.
        And I continue to use this philosphy whenever I work on a project. I am
        currently seeking my first professional role in the industry.
