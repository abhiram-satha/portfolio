        After 7+ years of working professionally as an accountant, I realized I was
        no longer fulfilled in the industry. That is when I decided to
        rediscover my long lost passion for creating websites. And to better
        enhance my skills, I enrolled myself into a bootcamp to learn more
        about the back-end and database to become a truly rounded Full-Stack Web Developer.
